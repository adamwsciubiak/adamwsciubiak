            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Armed with a Master's in Psychology and a postgraduate degree in User Experience/Product Design, I'm futher exploring the human mind and artificial intelligence on Research in Cognitive Science Master program. I'm on a mission of lavereging potential of cutting-edge tech to enchance our well-being.

            My journey has taken me across a spectrum of industries, allowing me to engage with everyone from curious toddlers, experienced professionals to people, who lived so much, so they can't keep track of anything are anymore. With a solid foundation in instructional and UX design, client relations, and psychological diagnostics, I've had the opportunity to apply my skills in diverse contexts. Whether I'm speaking "KPI" with executives or "API" with developers, I'm fluent in human.  I thrive on connecting with people and simplifying complex concepts—think of me as a translator of ideas between worlds.
            
            My fascination with artificial intelligence ignited in 2019 during a seminar, where I got hands-on with “Projekt Pisak.” That moment led me to dive deeper into machine learning, neuroscience, and human-computer interactions (HCI) through conferences, hackathons, and courses.
            
            Now, I’m focusing on creating AI-driven cognitive-behavioral interventions to assist adult learners emotional regulation on Adam Mickiewicz University and looking for professional opportunities that can benefit from my expetise.
            
            My next target is an industrial PhD, where I can push the boundaries of HCI, AI and neuroscience even further.</p>

                    <h3> The text below is a placeholder</h3>
                    <h4>Project Overview</h4>

                    <p> In this project, I am developing an Affective Intelligent Agent Model designed to enhance emotion regulation in adult learners through personalized cognitive-behavioral interventions. Recognizing that stress significantly impacts mental health and academic success, especially among students who often lack access to professional support due to cost and availability, this research leverages advancements in artificial intelligence to provide scalable and accessible mental health solutions.
                        
                    <h4>Background and Motivation</h4>
                        
                        Emotion regulation is a critical component of mental well-being, defined as the goal-oriented process of modifying one's affect to maximize adaptability to the current situation (Gross, 1999). Individuals often intuitively select emotion regulation strategies based on personality traits but may choose maladaptive methods leading to negative outcomes (Zhu et al., 2023). There is a pressing need for tools that assist individuals in selecting effective, adaptive strategies.
                        
                    <h4>The Affective Intelligent Agent Model</h4>
                        
                        The proposed model builds upon recent advancements in AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to create an agent capable of recognizing a user's emotional state and providing personalized interventions. The model consists of three key components:
                        
                        <b>Emotion Recognition</b>: Utilizing natural language processing, the agent analyzes user input to estimate valence and arousal levels, providing a quantitative measure of emotional states without invasive data collection.
                        
                        Dynamic Planning and Personalization: The agent employs a dynamic planner that considers the user's personality traits and emotional state to select appropriate emotion regulation strategies. By integrating the Beliefs-Desires-Intentions (BDI) framework (Rao & Georgeff, 1995), the model reasons about the best actions to achieve the desired emotional equilibrium.
                        
                        Intervention Execution: The agent delivers personalized cognitive-behavioral interventions based on established psychological theories, such as Gross's model of emotion regulation (Gross, 1999), and adapts over time through reinforcement learning strategies like Q-learning (Watkins & Dayan, 1992). This allows the agent to learn from each interaction, refining its approach to better suit individual users.
                        
                    <h4>Research Objectives</h4>
                        
                        The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Affective Intelligent Agent Model in enhancing emotion regulation among adult learners. Specifically, the research aims to:
                        
                        Demonstrate that personalized interventions mediated by the agent provide more effective emotion regulation support compared to non-personalized AI-based interventions.
                        Ensure the model delivers safe, theory-based, and appropriately matched interventions, validated by professional psychologists and computational methods.
                        Methodology
                        
                    </h4>Model Development and Evaluation: The model will undergo rigorous testing, including automatic benchmarking against existing models and manual validation by professional psychologists to ensure safety, accuracy, and appropriateness.
                        
                        Experimental Study: Approximately 60 adult learners will participate in a double-blind study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group (receiving personalized interventions) or the control group (receiving non-personalized interventions). Over two weeks to a month, participants will interact with the agent daily.
                        
                    <h4>Data Collection<h4>:
                        
                        Pre-test: Assessments include the Big Five Inventory (BFI) for personality traits and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).
                        Intervention Phase: Immediate affect changes and valence-arousal variances will be measured before and after each intervention.
                        Post-test: Re-assessment with DERS and semi-structured interviews to gauge user satisfaction and perceived effectiveness.
                        Data Analysis: Statistical methods will evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and qualitative data from interviews will provide insights into user experiences. AI tools like QualiGPT may assist in automating qualitative analysis.
                        
                        Anticipated Impact
                        
                        This project aims to contribute to the field of affective computing and mental health by developing a tool that makes cognitive-behavioral interventions more accessible and personalized. By minimizing costs and ensuring privacy, the model seeks to overcome barriers that prevent many individuals from accessing professional support.
                        
                        Challenges and Mitigation
                        
                        Participant Retention: Strategies include regular communication and incentives to maintain engagement throughout the study.
                        Data Privacy: Participants will be informed about data handling procedures, and anonymization tools will protect sensitive information.
                        Safety Concerns: The model will be thoroughly validated by professionals to prevent the delivery of harmful advice, and participants can report any issues immediately.
                        Future Directions
                        
                        Upon successful completion, the findings could pave the way for scalable AI-driven mental health tools that adapt to individual needs. The model has the potential to be extended beyond educational settings, offering support in various contexts where emotion regulation is crucial.
                        
                        Conclusion
                        
                        Through this research, I aim to bridge the gap between AI advancements and practical mental health support. The Affective Intelligent Agent Model represents a significant step toward providing accessible, personalized interventions, leveraging technology to address a critical need in our society.</p>

This enabled me to objectively assess the emotional tone of participants' writing.  A key finding was that individuals engaged in meditation tended to use more words related to positive emotions and cognitive processes in their narratives.

                        This project served as my introduction to the world of NLP and demonstrated the power of combining quantitative and qualitative methods for a more holistic understanding of complex psychological phenomena.

                    <h2>TLDR</h2>
                    <br>
                    To gather this data, I utilized a combination of questionnaires and a creative writing task. Participants completed assessments measuring their engagement in physical activity, yoga, and meditation, as well as their levels of mindfulness and creative self-belief.  They also wrote short stories based on prompts with either positive or negative emotional tones, allowing me to assess their verbal creativity.

                    The analysis involved both quantitative and qualitative approaches. I employed statistical methods to identify correlations between mindfulness, yoga, meditation, and different facets of creativity.  The creative writing samples were analyzed using LIWC software to delve deeper into the participants' emotional expression and language use.

                    Beyond the headline finding about meditation and positive emotions, the results revealed a nuanced interplay between mindfulness practices and creativity.  For example, the study indicated that specific dimensions of mindfulness, such as non-reactivity and non-judging, were linked to stronger creative self-efficacy.  This suggests that cultivating these particular mindfulness skills could potentially bolster an individual's confidence in their creative abilities.

                    While the study had limitations, such as the sample size and the use of a single measure of verbal creativity, it offers valuable insights into the complex relationship between mindfulness practices and creative expression.  The findings highlight the potential benefits of meditation for enhancing both mindfulness and positive emotional expression in creative writing.

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    In today's world, creativity is highly valued, and mindfulness practices like yoga and meditation are becoming increasingly popular. This research explores the fascinating relationship between these two phenomena.

                    The study uses Guilford's (1967) cognitive model, which differentiates convergent thinking (finding a single solution) from divergent thinking (exploring multiple possibilities). Divergent thinking, characterized by fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration, is the focus of this research.
                    
                    Traditional methods for enhancing creativity can be costly and time-consuming, prompting the need to investigate the relationship between creativity and more accessible practices like yoga and meditation.
                    
                    Meditation encompasses various techniques, including focused-attention meditation (FA), open-monitoring meditation (OM), and mindfulness meditation, which involves non-judgmental observation of present-moment experiences.
                    
                    Yoga combines physical exercise with mindfulness. Hatha yoga emphasizes physical development, while Ashtanga yoga incorporates a more profound meditative component.
                    
                    Both yoga and meditation offer various benefits, including stress reduction, improved mood, and enhanced cognitive abilities. Research suggests their potential to boost creativity, a subject explored in this study.
                    
                    The relationship between mindfulness, yoga, meditation, and creativity has been extensively studied. While some studies show a positive impact of mindfulness practices on creativity, others report less conclusive or even contradictory findings.
                    
                    This research aims to unravel the relationship between mindfulness, yoga, meditation, and verbal creativity. It hypothesizes that individuals engaged in yoga and meditation will exhibit higher scores on mindfulness and creativity scales, the emotional tone of a creative task will influence its performance, and LIWC software can provide an objective assessment of verbal creativity.

                    <h3>Results</h3>

                    The study revealed that individuals practicing meditation attained higher scores on the mindfulness scale compared to those who did not engage in meditation. However, a similar correlation was not found for yoga. Additionally, no significant disparities in verbal creativity levels were noted between those who practiced yoga and meditation and those who did not engage in these practices. The emotional tone of the task did not influence the level of performance.

                    Further analysis of the interplay between mindfulness, its sub-dimensions, creative self-efficacy, and identity unveiled statistically significant correlations. Specifically, non-reactivity and describing were correlated with creative self-efficacy and creative personal identity, while non-judging was correlated with creative self-efficacy.

                    LIWC software analysis of the narratives revealed that individuals practicing meditation employed more words associated with positive emotions and cognitive processes. No significant disparities in the utilization of other linguistic features were found between those who practiced yoga and meditation and those who did not engage in these practices.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    The study's findings partially corroborated the hypothesis regarding meditation's stimulating effect on mindfulness. However, no such effect was observed for yoga. This might be attributed to the participants' primary engagement in Hatha yoga, which predominantly focuses on physical aspects. It is plausible that other yoga types, such as Ashtanga yoga, which integrates meditation techniques more extensively, could exert a greater influence on mindfulness levels.

                    The absence of significant disparities in verbal creativity levels between those who practiced yoga and meditation and those who did not might stem from several factors. The sample size was relatively small, and the study employed a single measure of verbal creativity, potentially lacking the sensitivity to detect subtle intergroup differences. It is also possible that yoga and meditation influence creativity in other domains, such as visual or musical creativity.

                    The absence of any influence of the task's emotional tone on performance aligns with previous research (Baas et al., 2014), suggesting that emotional tone might not be a pivotal factor in creative performance. Alternatively, participants might have effectively regulated their emotions, enabling them to perform similarly regardless of the task's emotional tone.

                    The observed correlations between mindfulness, its sub-dimensions, creative self-efficacy, and identity resonate with prior studies (Lebuda et al., 2016), indicating that mindfulness could play a crucial role in developing creative self-beliefs and identity.

                    The LIWC software analysis outcomes also align with previous research (Fodor, 2008), suggesting that mindfulness might influence language usage. Individuals practicing meditation might possess heightened awareness of their thoughts and emotions, reflected in their use of words related to these experiences.

                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    
                    The study acknowledges several limitations. The sample size was relatively small and not representative. The reliance on a single measure of verbal creativity might have limited sensitivity. The cross-sectional design restricts causal inferences. The online data collection method might have influenced data quality.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                
                    The study partially confirms meditation's stimulating effect on mindfulness, but no such effect was observed for yoga. No significant differences in verbal creativity were found between practitioners and non-practitioners of yoga and meditation. The task's emotional tone did not influence performance.

                    Statistically significant correlations were found between non-reactivity, describing, and non-judging with creative self-efficacy and creative personal identity. LIWC analysis showed that meditation practitioners used more words related to positive emotions and cognitive processes.

                    These findings contribute new insights to the understanding of the interrelationships between the studied phenomena, prompt the verification of previous findings, and offer a starting point for future research.
