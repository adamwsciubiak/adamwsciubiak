            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a psychologist with expertise in UX design, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. My current research focuses on developing AI-driven cognitive-behavioral interventions for mental health. I hold a Master's degree in Psychology from the University of Wrocław and a postgraduate degree in UX & Product Design from SWPS University. My goal is to apply AI to create scalable, personalized tools for emotion regulation in educational and therapeutic settings.</p>

            <h2>Research Projects</h2>
            <h3>Current Projects</h3>
            <p>My ongoing research involves the development of an Affective Intelligent Agent Model for enhancing emotion regulation in adult learners. This AI-driven model adapts to users' emotional states to provide personalized cognitive-behavioral interventions. The project aims to make mental health interventions more accessible and scalable.</p>
            <h3>Past Research</h3>
            <p>Past research includes my Master's thesis, "Mindfulness in Yoga Practitioners and Meditators and Affective-Stimulated Verbal Creativity," where I explored the relationship between mindfulness and creativity using mixed methods. I also worked on a wearable-based project to measure cognitive effort using EEG and heart rate data.</p>
            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>In the future, I aim to expand the use of AI in mental health tools, focusing on scalability, accessibility, and personalized interventions for diverse user groups.</p>
